# quick-rps

This was a just a quick warm up for the day. Built a basic rock paper scissors game using prompts and alerts. The idea was to try to write clean and condensed javascript as quickly as possible. With testing from start to finish the project took about 30 min to complete from scratch. While this isnt the most useful app the project it was fun to put together and compare to an old rock paper and scissors game I built in my bootcamp. The retrospect helps me realize that I am in fact moving along in my journey as a web developer.
